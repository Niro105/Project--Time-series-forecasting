# ⏳ Time-series-forecasting

This repository contains a series of analysis, transforms and forecasting models frequently used when dealing with time series. The aim of this repository is to showcase how to model time series from the scratch, for this we are using a real usecase dataset(Company stock prices)

# 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the Company stocks prices. This dataset contains Companies stock prices from Oct 2020 to 2023 and it has the columns for 'Date,' 'Open,' 'High,' 'Low,' 'Close,' 'Adj Close,' and 'Volume.'   

# 📚 Analysis and transforms

* Time series decomposition
  
Level
Trend
Noise

* Stationarity

AC and PAC plots
Dickey-Fuller test

* Making our time series stationary

Difference transform

# 📐 Models tested

* linear Model
* Additive Seasonality
* Multi Seasonality
* Exponential Model
* Quadrative Model
* Additive Seasonality QT
* LSTM
* SVR

# 🔍 Forecasting results
we used LSTM model for forecasting the stock prices its fitted very well.

# Conclusion
* In LSTM-based stock price prediction model has proven to be a reliable and effective tool for forecasting the company's stock prices. This project provides a user-friendly interface for users to access accurate stock price predictions, aiding in investment decisions and strategic planning for the coming year.
